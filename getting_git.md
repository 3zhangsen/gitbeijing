This is getting git. It's not particular rails/ruby oriented. I will talk about capistrano and ruby libraries at the end, but for the most part, this is a tutorial on git. Just show your hands, how many of you are using git today?...OK this is so much different than last year, this is going into the internals of git, what actually git is doing, so that you can hopefully know a little bit better when you're running commands, have a better concept of what git is actully doing in the background and some of the commands that you may not use right now.

So...I will talk about the structure of the talk for a second. I will introduce myself ... I will tell you what git is...sort of why you should use it. How git works...how it works in the background, how it keeps its data, what is keeps in the git directory and so on. And I will tell you about how to use git some of the 20 or so commands that you will be using in the daily basis to do 95% of the stuff you can ever do with git. How to deploy with git, how to use git in your ruby code, and how you use capistrano to actually deploy with git, and where you can learn more.

SO...who am I? My name is Scott Schcon. You can find my stuff on github.
