Throughout 1960's and 1970's, most human interaction with computers was done
through what are called terminals. A terminal device is a piece of hardware
that combines the keyboard with some kind of character display, which in early
days in the 1960's was some kind of printer that print out characters line by
line. Or later in 1970's, it was usually a video console, but video console
was not capable of displaying arbitrary graphics, it can only display text
characters, and these text characters could only be displayed in a fixed grid.
They wouldn't have arbitrarily positioned characters anywhere on the screen,
and also the devices only have one display font and one display color. 

So the idea of terminal is that when they are hooked up to computer, the
computer then can send text characters and sequences to the terminal which get
displayed character by character on the screen and when the user sitting on
the keyboard types anything, a character sent from the terminal to the
computer, so does not need symmetry. A strict sequence of characters flows from
computer to the terminal and vice versa. AS you can probably guess, the text
going in both directions was almost ASCII text.
