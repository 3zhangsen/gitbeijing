00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,647
hi, hi, peter again

2
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:10,937
in our earlier talk we mentioned operators and motions

3
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:20,503
and how can we use both of them to constitute, uh... construct a whole vim command

4
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:23,963
are you still remembering general rules?

5
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:27,051
uh... let's say "hello world", something like this

6
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:34,366
you have, first type one operator, then a number, then motion

7
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:40,472
it's something like this. like "dj", anything like this

8
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:50,736
uh... we talk about that, but we didn't cover enough of those motions and  operators

9
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:59,234
of course not all of those operators, and all of them, uh... there are hundred of them

10
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:05,666
maybe not hundred of them, but certainly lots of them

11
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,545
we don't need to remember all of them, but there are still,

12
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:13,956
maybe a few of them that are really really useful.

13
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:19,552
so that I really need to talk about in our screencast

14
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:25,449
just now, I just think about that how to do this screencast

15
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:36,456
I certainly believe it will be really boring to just talk about operators and motions

16
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:42,679
in a plain way, I just type one by one, it will be really boring

17
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,484
like 'w', like 'jj' like 'j', something like this it will be boring

18
00:01:48,734 --> 00:02:02,694
so, but suddenly a good idea come to me, and I need to, I think I would rather to talk, give this screencast a topic

19
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:09,080
it's something uh... stupid. uh... named big and small

20
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,605
big and small, maybe you don't know what big and small means

21
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:24,103
here, I want to say, just I will talk about 'O', I talk about 'o'

22
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,377
it's lowercase 'o' and capital 'O'

23
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,233
so we just call it small 'o' and big 'O'

24
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:40,194
and, small 'y' and big 'Y', small 'p' and big 'P', small 'i' and big 'I'

25
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:48,252
so, uh... I'm Chinese, in China, we always talk about lowercase as something small

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,083
and the uppercase as something big

27
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,565
uh... I am not sure the native speakers talk this way

28
00:02:56,815 --> 00:03:01,626
uh... anyway I  don't care

29
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:06,758
so, but anyway why they arep so important, let me show you

30
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:13,144
so, first let's talk about how to go into insert mode from normal mode

31
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,603
it's the most often used one is 'i'

32
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:22,989
but, you know what is big 'I', it's like this, you type uh...

33
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,120
small 'i' and you are in insert right before the cursor

34
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:36,271
and if you type big 'I', then you start your insert at the beginning of the line

35
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,384
this is really useful

36
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:45,489
and another useful one is, you type 'a' and the small 'a'

37
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,949
uh... you can insert right after the cursor position

38
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,802
and if you want to start editing at the end of this line

39
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,613
you just type big 'A'

40
00:03:55,623 --> 00:04:00,164
it's like this the small 'a' and big 'A'

41
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:12,145
uh... OK, small 'a' and big 'A'. OK, now what small 'o' and big 'O' means?

42
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:24,150
small 'o' means this, you open, you go from normal mode to insert mode, but you open a new line

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,234
and this start editing. what big 'O' means? it's like this. you type big 'O' and

44
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:35,319
you also go to insert mode but you start a new line above the cursor position

45
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:47,579
so that's the difference. then uh... one common editing task is that you need to copy and paste

46
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:53,547
uh... in vim you don't call it copy, you call it yank, "yank", yank

47
00:04:53,797 --> 00:05:04,483
uh... maybe you don't know what "yank" means, you can help, try help 'y', like this

48
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:11,681
and also if you don't know any of those big and small bullshit

49
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:17,138
you can just help, help 'p', like this

50
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,530
and of course, you get a big 'P' here

51
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,149
and you can also check, maybe help 'w'

52
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,912
you also have small 'w' and big 'W'

53
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:32,579
that's different words, big word and small word

54
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:38,222
and they are different. you can check help file for more information

55
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:49,321
and anything you know vim help system is really powerful, you generally can find anything in the help system

56
00:05:49,571 --> 00:06:00,049
but we are not going show you all of them in our screencast... time is limited. so

57
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:10,126
let's continue. maybe I think,  I need talk about yank a paste. OK, how to yank a line

58
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:18,067
it's like this. 'y', OK, now this line is in one of those special buffer

59
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:26,357
then  I can type, put. it's not paste, it's like paste, but it's not paste

60
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:34,948
we call it put, then it's small 'p'. I'm sorry

61
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:39,662
you find to yank the whole line, you need to type 'yy'

62
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:43,377
and if you want to put, you type 'p'

63
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:52,711
and let's try again, you have, you have 'yy' here, now 'p'

64
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:57,263
you type 'p', then you put something below the current line

65
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:03,369
and, but if you type big 'P', you put something above the current line

66
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,622
so that's the difference

67
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:10,498
and yeah that's big and small

68
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:17,905
cut and paste, big and small, and anything

69
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:26,404
OK, that's my stupid idea of giving such name big and small

70
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:31,582
of this screencast to make things maybe a little more funny

71
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:34,577
uh... maybe it's not funny at all

72
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:41,311
but, OK that's all i want to talk about. so, enjoy, bye
