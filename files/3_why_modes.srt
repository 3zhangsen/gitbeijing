1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,926
uh... good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:10,054
one of the most obvious problems of my earlier screencasts is that

3
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:19,598
is that... the way I talk. I generally think it feels boring

4
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:23,174
to make screencasts and just talk to myself

5
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,844
and later I found it was wrong

6
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:32,972
and actually I should pretend you are just by my side and we talk like friends

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:42,910
later screencasts made this way shall be better anyway

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,765
and today ah... of course with no suprise

9
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:50,039
we continue to talk about vim

10
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:56,517
we start vim, and now we know vim has many modes

11
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:01,765
help vim modes. and the most important ones

12
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:05,155
of course, are normal mode

13
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:12,539
and insert mode

14
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,555
insert mode, this one yeah!

15
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:31,858
insert mode, but today I'd like to talk more about why vim has these modes

16
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:35,364
can we  just go without modes?

17
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:38,197
and the reason is like this

18
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,330
usually in the most other editors you don't have modes

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,439
you just work in one mode that is as it looks

20
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,132
and we call it insert mode, like vim insert mode

21
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:52,106
you always stay in  insert mode

22
00:01:52,356 --> 00:02:00,186
then sometimes you need some shortcut to make you work more efficiently

23
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:03,623
like you want delete one word

24
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:11,564
maybe you press "ctrl+d" or "ctrl+w"

25
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,513
and sometimes you need to do something more powerful

26
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:23,639
and you need to use like "ctrl +command +s"

27
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:29,490
and "ctrl +option +command+s" , something like these

28
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,363
you can't avoid these, if you really want some more powerful shortcuts

29
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:42,656
that's what is happening in some other editors all the time

30
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:51,549
it can do your work, but the problem is you struggle to use your fingers

31
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:55,404
and it feels really awful and it is not so efficient

32
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:56,193
and that's the problem.

33
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:01,139
that's why vim has its modes. and its normal mode is command mode

34
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:09,823
like this command mode. in this way you can do things much much simpler

35
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:15,744
and of course with price of have (having) different modes

36
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:19,158
that's a good price to pay

37
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,246
it's really rewarding. so no problem

38
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,288
at least I like it so much

39
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,074
and you can use "xx"

40
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:36,294
and "dd" to delete one word(one line).  you no longer need to struggle to your fingers

41
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:43,678
uh... painfully, so that's why vim has modes

42
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:49,413
and of course until now you still only need to know two modes

43
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,198
insert mode and normal mode

44
00:03:53,448 --> 00:04:00,373
so that's why vim has many modes

45
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:10,402
ok, let's call it a day. talk to you later. bye
