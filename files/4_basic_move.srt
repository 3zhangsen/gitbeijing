00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,666
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. now we are in vim

2
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:11,076
so today I want to talk about a little bit

3
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:16,951
why vim takes us first directly into normal mode

4
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:26,842
uh..., the fact is that in the normal mode you can actually modify your stuff fair easily

5
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:31,742
and efficiently. if you are in the insert mode, the movement,

6
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:41,982
uh..., will be, will have to use arrow key or something like this

7
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:48,483
it won't be so efficient. so in normal mode, everything can be done

8
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:56,842
much much simpler. uh..., so and in the career of a programmer

9
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:05,178
most of time will be spend on changing things rather than inserting things

10
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:11,308
inserting words, that's why normal mode first

11
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:15,627
so, now we are in normal mode

12
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:20,295
let's see how to move around in the normal mode

13
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:31,533
and first let's check the help file "help motion.txt"

14
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:38,592
uh..., if you want detailed information about how to move around

15
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:44,467
and also something about operators which we will talk about

16
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:53,546
maybe later in our next talk. you can check the manual here

17
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:59,211
but if everything can be found in the manual

18
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,555
what's the point of our screencasts?

19
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:14,397
our screencast is made so as to you don't need to read all the stuff in the manual

20
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:22,222
because in the manual there will be lot of details that... ah... peter wants you to learn later

21
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:27,702
not now. some of the details are really important

22
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:35,318
but i think it for beginners it is better to leave them alone

23
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:41,286
so you just need to follow peter and check out the basic stuffs and

24
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,374
build up your knowledge base step by step

25
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:48,298
later you will get to know all the basic things. you can say

26
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:52,989
" em... how can i do things a little bit more efficiently "

27
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,608
then you can check the manual and get all the powerful stuff out of it

28
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:05,202
so, let's talk about motion, let's talk about how to move around in vim

29
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:10,961
so as you can see, uh... we can move left

30
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:15,071
this way, move right. this way, move up

31
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:21,572
sorry, move down, move up, it's just 'h', 'j', 'k' , 'l'

32
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:27,215
and this is the basic movement and can we just move one word

33
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:30,953
a time just type 'wwww'

34
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:42,029
can we just move, uh..., the other way, like move half a page down

35
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:48,693
use "ctrl +d ", I think. I don't use "ctrl +d " very often

36
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:52,246
because I just love to move line by line

37
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:58,121
every time if you use "ctrl + d" and move inside big file, i got confused

38
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:04,367
I lost my track. en, that's not so good

39
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:09,452
uh..., how you move inside big files

40
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:13,608
let's make a big file. you don't need to know what I'm doing here

41
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,443
I am just making a big file

42
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:20,992
how can we move very quickly inside a big file

43
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:28,492
I use search. It's maybe called "moving by searching"

44
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:36,503
you do it this way. if I want move somewhere where I can find another main

45
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:40,242
uh..., I can do it this way

46
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:45,861
type "main", then press "enter", and now "nnn"

47
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:51,178
so, usually if I want to move inside big files

48
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,847
I do this way rather than just type "ctrl + d"

49
00:04:55,097 --> 00:05:07,014
for moving down half page. and "ctrl +u " for moving up half page also

50
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,056
I don't use them very often

51
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,469
so, that's the basic movement

52
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:25,749
and..., so let's stop here. and talk to you later, bye
