00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,598
hello everybody, this is Peter here

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:12,051
and today let's start our study of vim

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:15,650
the best editor that ever made

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,400
so let's just start at the very beginning, and

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,938
have a look at how to open a file with vim

6
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:27,818
it's like this, so you type vim

7
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:33,739
you see filename, then you just press enter

8
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:36,270
and here we are

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,358
so let's quit... quit

10
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:42,910
just capital z, z, twice

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,503
OK, let's quit vim, but of course that is not all you need to know

12
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:54,288
not all the ways how you can open sth with vim

13
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,866
you can also use this this way

14
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,838
like vim,  and "newfilename"

15
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:04,250
I mean, vim will creat a new file for you

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,824
like this, and you can also type sth here

17
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:16,510
I will show you how to edit a file in vim later

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,847
so like any powerful unix tool,

19
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:27,423
you can start vim with lots of options

20
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:31,371
and you can check all the options this way

21
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,736
the option I love is sth like this

22
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:39,486
remote and a few others

23
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,236
but that's not what we are going to talk in this episode

24
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:47,880
we will talk about (them) later

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,340
so I, I think, ahm...

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:01,231
let's... why not stop here, and we'll check how to do things later.

27
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,725
so have a good day, bye!
