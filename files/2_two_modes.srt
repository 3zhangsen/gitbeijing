00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,571
hello everybody

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:05,694
um...this is Peter here... peter again

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:13,955
so today we are going to explore more powerful stuff about ...

4
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:19,691
about vim... the best editor that ever, you know ...created

5
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:24,474
um ... so, let's start vim

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:31,370
ah... we are going to create a new file named hello.c
and  within this file

7
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:37,036
now what I want to talk about here is when you start vim

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,448
you directly come into the "normal mode"

9
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:45,140
so, you may wonder what the normal mode means

10
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:52,315
if you don't know normal mode means. Now I can tell you, it's just ...

11
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:57,516
when you start vim, vim directly take(s) you to normal mode

12
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:05,248
and now, you can try to type something, like 'd' and 'c'

13
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,081
Ah, you type something but nothing happened

14
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,657
So, you may feel strange here,

15
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:15,860
but this is actual not bug of vim

16
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,737
but rather it's a nice feature of vim.

17
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:24,056
it means vim has something called "modes"

18
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:31,649
so let's check how vim modes works

19
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,155
you just type help, "h" stands for "help"

20
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:39,869
help vim-modes, OK?

21
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,211
so you can see there are many modes here... many modes

22
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:49,343
but most ... now in this screencast I want to talk about really

23
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,827
only two of those modes

24
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:53,731
two most important one(s)

25
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,259
one is normal mode, the other one is I think...

26
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,465
insert mode, like this

27
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:07,896
so when you first come into ah...

28
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:14,792
into vim, ah... you first go into normal mode

29
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,300
normal mode also is called command mode

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,060
which means everything you type here will be considered as a command

31
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,029
and like 'x' for deleting one word(shall be a character)

32
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:33,763
and there are also some other commands that can take you into insert mode

33
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:37,513
like the most often used one is 'i'

34
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:41,100
press 'i', and vim will go into insert mode

35
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:50,783
and you can see in the lower left corner of this screen

36
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,314
you see a "insert"

37
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:56,913
insert, that means vim is now in insert mode

38
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:59,281
in insert mode, you can generally type something

39
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:02,579
like "sss", whatever you type here

40
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:11,890
will be considered as some visible characters, will show up eventually into your file

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,089
ah... in your file created, but when you press "esc"

42
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,202
you go back normal mode again

43
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:25,357
now whatever you type here, as we already mentioned, will be considered as command(s)

44
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,052
like you type 'x'

45
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:35,156
then ah... you delete one word(shall be one character) rather than insert "x" into your file

46
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:38,871
so that is the difference, as you type "dd", so "dd", whole line

47
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,621
as you type 'u', it means undo

48
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:47,161
you can type "ctrl + r", means redo

49
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:52,618
anyway, don't worry if you can not remember all these things

50
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:54,986
we will talk about these in details later

51
00:03:55,236 --> 00:04:00,489
anyway in this talk, I just want you know

52
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,899
vim has modes and most important two modes I want you know

53
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,943
here is just two

54
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:11,356
normal mode and insert mode

55
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:19,529
so, you still remember how to go into insert mode? you type 'i'

56
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:30,118
and like this, you press "Esc" and you go back to normal mode

57
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,324
normal mode is also called command mode

58
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:36,805
which means you type everything as commands

59
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:40,961
so this is all I want to talk about here

60
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:45,977
I hope you are not confused, but anyway

61
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:49,622
it doesn't matter. we will talk about more later

62
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:55,822
so have a good day. bye
