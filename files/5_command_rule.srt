1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,005
hi, you, good afternoon. so, now, I am not feeling very uh... very great

2
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:18,251
uh... since I have a little bit stomachache

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:25,008
uh... my stomach hurts a bit. it's OK, not so horrible

4
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,257
uh... you know, human beings are just animals

5
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:34,249
except that we can think, we talk, we work

6
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:41,494
uh..., so when our life get messy . I think at least for me it is true

7
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:47,972
I tend to think about doing something that make some sense

8
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:56,541
so it can probably set our heart peaceful and put us on the right track

9
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:03,692
so, and doing technology is one of things do make me feel peaceful

10
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:08,406
because technology is just something fun, it's no big deal, right?

11
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:15,511
just like this, OK, so if you don't mind

12
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:20,341
let's start, continue our study of vim

13
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:26,819
OK, let's see what we can do, let's start vim

14
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,909
check what's in this

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,022
uh... it's bullshit, OK

16
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:40,496
we don't need. OK, so, now let's create a new file

17
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:47,485
we don't always create '.c' file, we can create any file

18
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:53,824
OK, and maybe we type something, go to insert mode and type something

19
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:57,005
I'm sure you now know how to go to insert mode

20
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:01,789
and maybe you already read the help file and

21
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:12,493
you know the difference between switching among those modes, normal mode and insert mode

22
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:16,185
and a bit more, other modes

23
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:24,637
so, today I want to talk about is still motions

24
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,262
motions, how to move around

25
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:32,323
let's say, we have "hello world"

26
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:37,942
and how to, you know how to move to the beginning of this line

27
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:45,280
it's zero. and end, dollar. zero, dollar

28
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:58,004
zero, I'm sorry. uh... so, you know how to move one word a time. "ww" and

29
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:03,507
now, guess how to move two words a time. it's  '2w'

30
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:05,690
I'm sorry, it's not clear

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:19,854
it's like this. "hello world peter is your friend", move to the beginning , it's three 'w'

32
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:25,148
'3w' and maybe '2w', like this

33
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:33,322
and now guess how to move two lines down one time

34
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,737
in one go, it's just,

35
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:39,382
we go to the... first go to the top of this file

36
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:44,560
done by "gg", and two 'j'

37
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,970
two 'j', it's "gg"

38
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,096
two 'j' and "gg", three 'j' and it's like this

39
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:09,382
now, you can see it's just a number with a motion, and that will just do

40
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:15,164
what you want in a very obvious and maybe a little bit childish way

41
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,624
and it's the motion

42
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:27,424
uh... but what I want talk about here is the general rule of vim operation

43
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:35,319
it's one operator and then followed with a motion

44
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,706
let's check the general rule. first you don't know what the operator is maybe

45
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:45,350
so let's check what operator is, let's check maybe help operators, I'm not sure

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,804
help operators, help operator, OK I think we are luck

47
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:58,864
operators are some things like change, like 'c', change a word

48
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:02,835
like "d", delete a word, "yank",something like copy

49
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:08,709
yank means copy, and lots of other more

50
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,189
those are... I think those are operators, but currently we focus on something simple

51
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,116
like change and delete

52
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:27,262
uh... let's show how to work using operators and motions the same time. OK

53
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:36,573
like, let's try to delete two words. in one go, it is 'd' two 'w'. OK

54
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:42,750
uh... undo this thing. 'd' three word

55
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:52,804
OK, and how can we delete from this line to the end of this file

56
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:58,237
'd' then the motion 'G' to the end of file

57
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:00,258
yeah, easy, yeah

58
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:05,436
it's how to delete from this line to top of this file. 'd' and "gg"

59
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:13,214
OK, so let's try d (delete) four word

60
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:24,940
OK, I think you can see the rules, very,  it's very childish, but it is very convenient.

61
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,979
so, let's see how to delete two lines. let's go up, go up

62
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,879
delete two lines, 'd' two 'j', two lines

63
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:42,889
like three lines, anyway, it's 'd' two 'j', like this

64
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,693
so, if you want know more, if peter here is not giving you very clear explanation

65
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:58,656
you can check more in documentation yourself. it's like help motions. motions, I think

66
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:09,523
motions dot txt, you can get things here. how to move around and how to use operators with motions

67
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:21,783
uh... you know what I mean by talking about motions, motions, we can check motions

68
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:31,349
characters motions

69
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,133
uh... it doesn't so matter. but uh...

70
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:55,243
OK, anyway you can get anything here, like what's operator, operator, it's not so easy to get operator

71
00:07:55,493 --> 00:08:00,560
you can get this way. operator... motions and operators.

72
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,580
you can check this part

73
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:14,562
this part for more information. so that's the general rule of vim

74
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:23,153
uh... how to use vim in this normal mode. the general rule is one operator then followed with some motion

75
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:27,820
command, motion commands can be multiplied by numbers

76
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,904
three 'w' like two 'w'. it's like this, like this

77
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:39,546
like, now I want to change three words. 'c' three 'w'

78
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:47,000
you see, then we type something new. "hello", then press "Esc"

79
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,946
then you see three words changed into one word, in this way

80
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:59,585
anyway, still the same thing, change words, like this "hello", OK

81
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,838
easy, uh?

82
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:10,545
those general rule of vim, of course you can use those many many different ways, because there are

83
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:19,508
still other more operators and other more motions, check help file and enjoy the power. so

84
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:25,104
anyway, OK. let's call it today. my stomach still hurts.

85
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:34,485
uh... but I've done something meaningful and I feel my life is meaningful. OK

86
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:39,106
OK, stop talking all these nonsense. have a good day.

87
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:42,856
talk to you later
